If all goes well, run ./1.sh and all is done.
However I'm working for machines and systems compatibility,
So if you don't have gfortran nor MATLAB installed,
I can do nothing for it.
Actually almost always you can't run it,
Which even won't work on my own computer either.
Sometimes you can fix it with little change on the scripts,
But if you don't, just keep calm and forget it.

Nevertheless if you can't see the comments,
